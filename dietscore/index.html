    <h2 class="title-intro">Measure your design teams confidence in flight</h2>

     <p><strong>Reasons design teams use DIET</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improves the efficency and visability of design at scale across teams and locations</li>
        <li>Acts as an early indicator of needs for additional skills</li>
        <li>A standardised communication tool for stakeholder engagement</li>
        <li>Its easy, free and we all want to work on the things that matter the most</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to use DIET</h2>

      <p>
        DIET is based on the <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond">Double Diamond</a> which is the name of a design process model developed by the British Design Council in 2005.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Design Council discovered designers across disciplines share strikingly similar approaches to the creative process, which they mapped out as ‘the Double Diamond’.
      </p>
      <p>
        DIET promps teams to answer a set of questions, before moving on to the next stage of the Diamond.
        The answers to the questions give the team a score and advice on what to do next.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DIET score gives a standardised communication method for teams to get the help when they need it. Over time it shows patterns of why projects die, and can be used to improve team health, get stakeholder engagement, or to help improve communication across a business. And ultimately allow designers to do their best work.

     <h2>DIET has 3 scoring stages</h2>
     <p>
      <strong><a href="strategy.html">1. Strategy</a></strong>
      when you first hear about the project, or  you've defined a problem through continious research
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong><a href="problem.html">2. Problem</strong></a>
       once you have completed your research into the problem space
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong><a href="solution.html">3. Solution</a></strong>
       when you have designed and tested your solution
     </p>

      <h2>What is the theory behind DIET?</h2>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://twitter.com/doingdesignops">DesignOps team</a> at <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/" target="_blank">Co-op Digital</a> mapped out the journey of a project from start to finish with multiple teams. Like the Britsh Design Council we too found they followed the pattern of the Double Diamond.
      </p>
      <p>
          Some projects followed the double diamond exactly, some with successful outcomes, others ditched or pivotted. some projects skipped from one segment of the Diamond to another. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects can be hard in big businesses as the strategy can but lost in translation. Therefore teams are unsure on business needs or don't have the skills or confidence to be as effective as they could be.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="img/journeyofaproject.png" alt="Double Diamond">
        <figcaption>Examples of how 3 projects followed the double diamond path in different ways, which resulted in different outcomes.</figcaption>
      </figure>


      <h2>Diamonds with extra bits</h2>
      <p>
          The double diamond is a well known artifact amongst the design community. However as many people have illutrated before we miss the bit before 'strategy' and the bit after 'ship'.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two parts are integral in delivering effective design solutions. If we don't understand the strategy then the solution often doesn't get shipped.
      </p>

        <img src="img/strategy.png" alt="Double Diamond">
        <figcaption>The double diamond with extras bits, before 'strategy' and after 'ship'.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Expectation to just get it done</h2>
      <p>
          If we consider the strategy to be part of a chain, linked to many other projects across multiple products.
      </p>
      <p>
          Getting into the strategy space is important but delve too deep and projects can balloon and take a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
          It's no wonder there is often an expectation from stakeholder of just getting the thing done.
          Juggling multiple projects and having an expectation of delivery within a timeframe must be tough.
      </p>

        <figcaption>The strategy chain and deliver chain. Is there an expectation that the faster route should be taken?</figcaption>
      </figure>
     
      <h3>Death of a project</h3>
      <p>
          When more time than is expected is spent in the problem or solution space projects can often die.
          Questions like "Why are we doing ths research?" or "We already know this is true" and "Why is this taking so long?" can be very disheartening for designers. And kill momentum as the team is in mid discovery mode, the direction changes.
      </p>

      </figure>
        

      <h2>Inside the problem &amp; solution space</h2>
      <p>
          As a design team we mostly spend our time in the "Problem" and "Solution" space.
          So how can we be more effective here? And communicate our needs clearly across teams?
      </p>

      <h2>DIET scoring stages</h2>
      <p>
          The DIET (Design Impact Evaluation Tactic) scoring stages encourage teams to stop and answer important questions at key stages of the project.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="img/dietscore.png" alt="Double Diamond">
        <figcaption>The DIET scoring stages, shown against the double diamond they include - strategy score, problem score and solution score</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>DIET scoring stages</h2>
      <p>
          A low score at the strategy stage may indicate the team need more time, or more stakeholder enagement. Both issues are common in projects yet occur time and time again. 
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img src="img/dietoutcome.png" alt="Double Diamond">
      <figcaption>The DIET scores are stored in a spreadsheet to help reveal patterns over time. </figcaption>
    </figure>
      <p>
          Teams change, stakeholders come and go, the shapes of the problems change. DIET is a constant, a reminder that the basics are important.
      </p>
      <p>
          Overtime DIET can be a powerful persuation tool, outcomes are important to businesses. Time, resourcing, recruiting and money are also key to a businesses survival. If you have 100 projects that have a DIET score, you can pin point common opportunites for improvement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If 20 out of your 100 projects got ditched due to stakeholders not being involved. And the other 80 evolved and achieve the business outcome. That is powerful, not many business minded people will ignore those stats.
